First, let's understand what this means. Say we have the set $X = \{1,2,3\}$, then a valid triple would be $A = \{1\}, B = \emptyset, C = \{2,3\}$.

Since the sets $A,B,C$ must be pairwise disjoint, each element in $n$ can only appear in one of the 3 sets, or none of them.

This gives us 4 options for each element in $n$, counting all these elements will give us $4^n$.
